As a user, I would like to check the unit price for each device. - Whenever we add a new device, you should generate the device price as an integer random number between 350 and 750.

As a user, I would like to view all of my devices that I already added so that I can quickly view my devices. - Whenever you add a device using the form, you should use the local storage in order to get all the devices from it and render them as a table using DOM.

As a user, I would like to view the total prices of all the dvices that I have in the table - whenever you add a new device, you should display the updated value of totals under the table
